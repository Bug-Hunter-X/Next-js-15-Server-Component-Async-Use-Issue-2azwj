This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Next.js 15 related to the interaction between asynchronous functions, the `use` function, and server components within `getServerSideProps`. The bug is characterized by unexpected behavior when asynchronous operations are involved: data might be stale or rendering incorrect. The solution provides a way to refactor the code to ensure the `use` function correctly reflects the outcome of the asynchronous operation.  Please refer to the `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` files for code samples.
