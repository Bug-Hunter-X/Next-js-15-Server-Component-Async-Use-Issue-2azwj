In Next.js 15, an uncommon issue arises when using server components with `async` functions and `use` within the `getServerSideProps` function.  The `use` function might not behave as expected, potentially leading to stale data or unexpected rendering. This is particularly problematic when asynchronous operations are involved, as the `use` function might not correctly reflect the updates triggered by those operations within the server component lifecycle.
